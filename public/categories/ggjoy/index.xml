      <description>Haven’t you run into articles with some data that makes you think, how can visualize the data in a different and possibly better way?
 We will be use Joyplots for this post.
Joyplots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space 1.
The data that we will be looking at is 2016 temperatures in Lincoln, NE 23.</description>
