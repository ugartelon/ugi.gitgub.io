      <description>In this post we will analyze Madrid’s electric bike hire service, BiciMAD (in London Santander Cycles, in Paris Vélib, etc…). We will create calendar heatmaps and a growth chart using the publicly available data.
 Libraries We first install and load the libraries.
library(ggplot2) # For amazing charts library(tidyverse) # Data wrangling library(hrbrthemes) # Aesthetic defaults for ggplot2 charts library(readr) # Reading data from csv library(formattable) # Friendy data frame can be rendered as HTML table library(lubridate) # Makes it easier to work with dates and times  Importing data The data can be obtained from datosabiertos - the free and open data-sharing portal where anyone can access data relating to the Madrid 1.</description>

      <title>JSON and mapping long/lat</title>
      <link>https://www.storieswithdata.com/post/2017/09/12/json-and-mapping-long-lat/</link>

      <description>Today we will extract information from a JSON document using the R package jsonlite and we will then plot lon/lat in a map using the R package leaflet.
The data that we will be looking at is crime in LA.
But first, we need to install and load libraries for this excercise.
library(jsonlite) library(tidyverse) library(stringr) library(tibble) library(leaflet) library(ggmap) library(readr) Now we can start grabbing the data from the json document which can be found here 1.</description>

      <title>Joyplots with ggjoy &#43; hrbrthemes</title>

      <description>Haven’t you run into articles with some data that makes you think, how can visualize the data in a different and possibly better way?
 We will be use Joyplots for this post. Joyplots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space1.
The data that we will be looking at is 2016 temperatures in Lincoln, NE23.</description>

      <description>Note: Thanks to those who share their ideas and help others make things happen seamlessly.
 Finally! I now have a blog. All thanks to the R package Blogdown. With Blogdown you can creat a personal website.
 After reading many articles, watching videos and multiple failed attempts, I was able to get my picked Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
There are many articles on the topic but the place I strongly recommend you visit is a youtube video by John Muschelli:</description>

      <description>After a hard time getting around creating the blog, here it is!
The goal of this blog is to collect, inspect, cleanse, transform, and visualize data to discover useful information and suggest conclusions. Data that we can find anywhere these days thanks to the web. The idea is ultimatley to have fun working with such data. We will be using R to perform all the analysis - and in particular dplyr.</description>
