      <description>Note: Thanks to those who share their ideas and help others make things happen seamlessly.
 Finally! I now have a blog. All thanks to the R package Blogdown. With Blogdown you can creat a personal website.
 After reading many articles, watching videos and multiple failed attempts, I was able to get my picked Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
There are many articles on the topic but the place I strongly recommend you visit is a youtube video by John Muschelli:</description>

      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.
1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <description>After a hard time getting around creating the blog, here it is!
The goal of this blog is to collect, inspect, cleanse, transform, and visualize data to discover useful information and suggest conclusions. Data that we can find anywhere these days thanks to the web. The idea is ultimatley to have fun working with such data. We will be using R to perform all the analysis - and in particular dplyr.</description>
