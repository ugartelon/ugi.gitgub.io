>Finally! I now have a blog. All thanks to the R package Blogdown. With Blogdown you can creat a personal website.

After reading many articles, watching videos and multiple failed attempts, I was able to get my picked Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.

There are many articles on the topic but the place I strongly recommend you visit is a youtube video by John Muschelli:

* Making A Website with RStudio Part1^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9uuyJzWzCI&t=1472s]

Here are briefly the main steps one has to follow:

* Install Git and configure Git on your machine 
* Configure RStudio to use git
* Setting up a GitHub repository
* RStudio and blogdown
* Deploying or publishing website (I am using Netlify)

The link I recommend you to watch shows all the steps except for installing, configuting Git. The bit that I probably found most difficult but, in reality is not, is ensuring the path to the Git executable from R Studio is correct. Plenty of videos and articles on the topic through out the internet though.

Happy Blog!Hope so!
