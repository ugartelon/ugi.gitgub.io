After a hard time getting around creating the blog, here it is! 

**The goal** of this blog is to collect, inspect, cleanse, transform, and visualize data to discover useful information and suggest conclusions. Data that we can find anywhere these days thanks to the web. The idea is ultimatley to have fun working with such data. We will be using R to perform all the analysis -  and in particular dplyr. 

My name is Pablo Ugarte and I live in Madrid, Spain. I am 35 and have worked in different fields of Finance: Ratings Research,  Wealth Management and Regulatory experience in London, UK. I recently came back to Spain. 

In my spare time I like discovering new places with my girlfriend travelling through out Spain. I find sports and particularly MMA fascinating - having practised time ago bjj (brazilian jujitsu). Love politics, reading essays and history-related topics, movies and all sort of documentaries.

I hope you enjoy this little but exciting adventure. Gracias!
